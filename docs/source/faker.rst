Faker Class
===========

Overview
--------

The ``Faker`` class is your go-to guy for generating all sorts of Nigerian data. You can think of it as your ultimate data plug â€” whether you need to generate Nigerian names, email addresses, phone numbers, state information or even school data.

Initialization
--------------

Setting up the ``Faker`` class is as easy as `ABC`. Just import the class and create an instance of ``Faker``, and you're good to go:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from fakernaija import Faker
    >>> naija = Faker()

In this example, we created an instance of the ``Faker`` class named ``naija``. Now, this ``naija`` has access to all available methods from the ``Faker`` class.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> # Generate a Nigerian currency
    >>> currency = naija.currency()
    >>> print(f"Nigerian currency: {currency}")

    >>> # Generate a Nigerian full name
    >>> name = naija.full_name()
    >>> print(f"Nigerian name: {name}")
