# Fakernaija

**Fakernaija** is a Python library designed to help developers generate realistic Nigerian-specific data like full names, email addresses, phone numbers, bank information, jobs, schools, states, license plate numbers, and much more. Whether you're working on testing, development, or educational projects, Fakernaija can help you generate random data with Nigerian contexts, including a CLI for easy data exports.

The documentation is available on [Read the Docs](https://fakernaija.readthedocs.io).
